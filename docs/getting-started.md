# Getting started


## Developing LAMBKIN

### Development Containers

Most packages in LAMBKIN support [development containers](https://containers.dev/). There is even a full repository development container available. You may use these through [`vscode` IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) or [`devcontainers` CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli).

### Build Tooling

As an heterogeneous collection of software packages, LAMBKIN does not usually afford single full builds. That said, [`colcon`](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) (plus extensions such as `colcon-cmake`, `colcon-ros`, and `colcon-poetry-ros`) will take you a long way.
