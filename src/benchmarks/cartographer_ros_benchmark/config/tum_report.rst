Dataset
~~~~~~~

TUM dataset consists of four sequences from an ActivMedia Pioneer 3 robot.
In the *Pioneer 360* sequence, the robot was driven in a loop around the center of the (mostly) empty hall.
The other sequences were recorded in a large hall with several office containers and boxes.
*Pioneer SLAM 1*, *Pioneer SLAM 2* and *Pioneer SLAM 3* differ in the actual trajectories but
all contain several loop closures.

A motion capture system from MotionAnalysis was used to record the ground-truth trajectory,

Metrics
~~~~~~~

The following metrics were selected to understand different aspects of the SLAM system
under test.

To estimate quality of the SLAM system:

- **APE** (Absolute Pose Error): compares the reconstructed trajectory to the actual trajectory.
- **RPE** (Relative Pose Error): compares the reconstructed relative transformations between
  nearby poses to the actual relative transformations.

To estimate performance of the SLAM system:

- **RSS** (Resident Set Size): amount of space of physical memory (RAM) held by the SLAM system.
- **CPU Usage**: ratio between the time spent by the SLAM system, in both user and kernel space,
  and the total system time elapsed.

Aggregated information is provided for statistical analysis of the results.
For each metric, its median, mean, and standard deviation are provided.

Results
-------

In the following sections, a description of each sequence and the resulting
metrics generated by the benchmarking pipeline are presented.

Pioneer 360
~~~~~~~~~~~

This sequence was recorded from a Pioneer robot joysticked on the spot for a
(more than) 360-degree turn.

Pioneer SLAM 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This sequence was recorded from a Pioneer robot joysticked through a maze of tables, containers and other walls, so that several loops have been closed for map building.
