Definition
----------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LAMBKIN ran Cartographer ROS with the following configuration. Selected parameters
include: the dataset sequences that were used, the input sensor topics, the
duration of each run, the publish rate factor, the trajectories to compare and
the amount of iterations.

.. include:: rawseeds_benchmark.robot
   :code: robotframework

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
- ROS: ROS Noetic Ninjemys
- SLAM system: Cartographer ROS 1.0.0

Dataset
~~~~~~~

The location is set into a pair of building belonging to the Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca,
in Milan (Italy). The part of the location explored by the robot during the gathering of
the sequences includes one floor of an office building and the corresponding floor of a
nearby building. The two buildings are connected by roofed, glass-walled bridges. They sport
a wide range of different of architectural features, which are summarized below.

These sequences were converted to ROS 1 bagfiles with a custom tool.

Metrics
~~~~~~~

The following metrics were selected to understand different aspects of the SLAM system
under test.

To estimate quality of the SLAM system:

- **APE** (Absolute Pose Error): compares the reconstructed trajectory to the actual trajectory.
- **RPE** (Relative Pose Error): compares the reconstructed relative transformations between
  nearby poses to the actual relative transformations.

To estimate performance of the SLAM system:

- **RSS** (Resident Set Size): amount of space of physical memory (RAM) held by the SLAM system.
- **CPU Usage**: ratio between the time spent by the SLAM system, in both user and kernel space,
  and the total system time elapsed.

Aggregated information is provided for statistical analysis of the results.
For each metric, its median, mean, and standard deviation are provided.
