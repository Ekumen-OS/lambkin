Definition
----------

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LAMBKIN ran SLAM Toolbox with the following configuration. Selected parameters
include: the dataset sequences that were used, the input sensor topics, the
duration of each run, the publish rate factor, the trajectories to compare and
the amount of iterations.

.. include:: magazino_benchmark.robot
   :code: robotframework

Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
- ROS: ROS Noetic Ninjemys
- SLAM system: SLAM Toolbox 1.5.6

Dataset
~~~~~~~

Magazino dataset is published as part of the Cartographer Public Data repository and is
commonly used for testing SLAM systems setup under ROS.

Metrics
~~~~~~~

The following metrics were selected to understand different aspects of the SLAM system
under test.

To estimate quality of the SLAM system:

- **APE** (Absolute Pose Error): compares the reconstructed trajectory to the actual trajectory.
- **RPE** (Relative Pose Error): compares the reconstructed relative transformations between
  nearby poses to the actual relative transformations.

To estimate performance of the SLAM system:

- **RSS** (Resident Set Size): amount of space of physical memory (RAM) held by the SLAM system.
- **CPU Usage**: ratio between the time spent by the SLAM system, in both user and kernel space,
  and the total system time elapsed.

Aggregated information is provided for statistical analysis of the results.
For each metric, its median, mean, and standard deviation are provided.
