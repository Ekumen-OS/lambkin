This document is limited to the presentation of the methodology and the results used to gather the performance data.

No root-cause analysis of issues or performance tuning is performed in this document.

For the sake of brevity, a limited number of configuration variants are used in the experiments: the sensor model and the motion model.
The rest of the configuration parameters are kept at their default values, which are the same for both AMCL implementations.
