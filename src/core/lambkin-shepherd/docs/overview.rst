LAMBKIN's ``shepherd`` is the main library and tool for benchmark orchestration included in the toolkit. Built on top of the `RobotFramework <https://robotframework.org/>`_, ``shepherd`` provides structure to benchmarks and binds all other tools within (or external yet compatible with) the toolkit for seamless use.
